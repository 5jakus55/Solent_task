This is the second part of react js web application project for module Contemporary Web Applications (Solent University) 
The purpose of this project was to help students with their everyday difficulties they might face during the time at University. Multiple surveys have been conducted in order to create a useful design of a SolenTask manager application, as it has been proven that students most struggle with the time management and tasks from tutors.

Therefore, a task manager application has been designed in Figma, and developed using ReactJS, Firebase, and Firestore.
The application consists of the following pages:
* Login page and Signup page - using Firebase authentication and store user details in Firebase
* Home page - main welcome page 
* Profile page - user details page 
* Create task page - create a task form and store it in Firestore
* Tasks page - tasks from tutors
* Analytics page - insights from the progress and completition of the tasks
* PomodoTimer page - a page using pomodoro timer to help students concentrate
* SOL page - a page with a link to Solent Online Learning website 

Multiple components have been created to add a functionality to the design, such as:
* Button
* Hamburger Menu
* Login and Signup form
* Timer

Some parts of the code don't work in deployed version, such as:
1. Create task button in Homepage and Create Task pages
2. Sign Up page doesn't work properly - and therefore only login is available on deployed version
3. Create task form is not finished as there have been issues passing the data into Firestore
